Odin bindings for the Miniz library

The Miniz library can be found here - https://github.com/richgel999/miniz

Odin language - https://odin-lang.org

I copied the stb_* style as used in vendor

These bindings were written by hand

I made sure that two examples worked from the beginning

These bindings focus on the ZIP part of miniz. If you are looking for zlib compression, check out - https://pkg.odin-lang.org/vendor/zlib/
